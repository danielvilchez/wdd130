        <h3>CONTENT</h3>
        <p>Helping others is a good thing because it creates important connections between people and makes us feel good. 
            Contributing to the well-being of others gives us purpose and can improve our mental health. 
            It also strengthens our communities and teaches values such as empathy and responsibility. 
            In addition, when we help someone, it often inspires others to do the same, creating a positive effect. 
            In short, helping others is not only beneficial to them, but also enriches our own lives.</p>

        <h3>MESSAGE</h3>
        <p>In our daily journey, we come across people facing difficulties, whether they are economic challenges, health problems or simply loneliness. 
            Each of us has the ability to alleviate these burdens and contribute to building a more compassionate and caring environment.
            It is not necessary to do great things, it is enough to have the intention to help and to do it, that will make us able to make more people happy.</p>
